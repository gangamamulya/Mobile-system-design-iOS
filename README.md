# iOS Mobile System Design Roadmap

This README provides a detailed roadmap for designing an iOS mobile system architecture, covering key areas from gathering requirements to system constraints, defining APIs, database choices, performance optimization, and scalability considerations. This guide follows best practices to ensure a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) while ensuring future scalability.

## 1. Gathering Requirements

### 1.1. Functional Requirements
- **Core Features**: Identify and outline the primary features and user actions.
- **User Types**: Define the types of users that will interact with the system (e.g., end-users, admins).
- **External Services**: Specify any third-party API integrations required.
    * What are the core features that the system should support?
    * Are there any particular features that are more critical than others?
    * Who will use this system (customers, internal teams etc..)?
    * What specific actions should users be able to perform on the system?
    * How will users interact with the system (web, mobile app, API, etc.)?
    * Does the system need to support multiple languages or locales?
    * What are the key data types the system must handle (text, images, structured data, etc). It can influence your database choices.
    * Are there any external systems or third-party services the system needs to integrate with?


### 1.2. Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Define required response times and performance benchmarks.
- **Security**: Identify the data protection and privacy standards.
- **Scalability**: Understand how the system should scale with users.
- **Offline Access**: Determine the necessity for offline functionality and caching.
- **Localization**: Identify the need for multi-language support or regional adaptations.
   * Will the app require offline functionality?
   * Are we handling the authentication part or is it out of scope?
   * Do we need to encrypt the data?

### 1.3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Prioritize core features for the initial product release, focusing on delivering essential functionality first.

## 5. High-Level System Design

### 5.1. Client-side Responsibilities
- **Photo Capture Module**: Manages photo capture and uploads.
- **Photo View Module**: Displays photos in the gallery view, with zoom functionality and interactions.
- **Offline Mode**: Supports offline access by caching locally encrypted photos and queuing uploads.

### 5.2. Backend-side Responsibilities
- **Storage**: Handles photo storage using cloud services such as AWS S3 or Firebase.
- **API Handling**: Manages requests and responses for photo uploads, downloads, album management, and sharing.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Ensures low-latency responses by caching metadata and photos, and using efficient storage mechanisms.

### 5.3. Storage Strategies

- **Caching**: Frequently accessed thumbnails are cached using **NSCache** for faster retrieval.

### 6.2. Server-Side Storage
- **Blob Storage**: Storing large binary objects (BLOBs) such as photos directly in the database can be avoided by storing them in the cloud. The database stores references (e.g., URLs) to the images in cloud storage services such as **AWS S3** or **Firebase**.

---

## 7. Performance and Optimization Techniques

### 7.1. API Call Management
- **Caching**: Store API responses locally to reduce network requests and handle offline scenarios.
- **Batching**: Group API requests (e.g., uploading multiple photos) to reduce overhead and optimize performance.
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensure the system uses rate-limiting strategies to avoid overwhelming the server.

### 7.2. UI Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Photos are loaded on-demand to reduce initial load time and improve performance, especially for large photo libraries.
- **Progressive Loading**: Use low-resolution placeholders while the full-resolution image is being downloaded.
- **Memory Management**: Manage memory carefully by unloading off-screen images and caching visible ones.

### 7.3. Offline Access
- **Prefetching**: Preload images when the user is on a stable connection, so that the user experience is seamless even during poor network conditions.
- **Queued Uploads**: When offline, uploads are queued and processed when the app is back online.

---

## 8. Security and Privacy

### 8.1. Data Encryption
- **AES Encryption**: Photos stored locally are encrypted using **AES-256** to ensure privacy.
- **TLS/HTTPS**: All communication between the client and server is secured using TLS/HTTPS, ensuring data privacy during transit.

### 8.2. Secure Authentication
- **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT**: Tokens are used to authenticate users and control access to photos and albums.

### 8.3. Privacy Considerations
- **GDPR Compliance**: The app follows best practices for handling user data, ensuring consent is collected and personal data is stored securely.

---

## 9. Scalability and Bottleneck Analysis

### 9.1. Bottlenecks
- **Database Performance**: Handling large numbers of users and photo uploads can be bottlenecked by database performance. Scaling strategies such as **read replicas** and **partitioning** may be necessary.
- **Network Latency**: Slow networks may affect photo uploads and downloads. Strategies like batching, caching, and rate limiting can mitigate these issues.

### 9.2. Scaling Techniques
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances to handle large numbers of users.
- **Database Replication**: Use database replication and sharding to ensure high availability and performance under heavy load.
- **CDN Integration**: Use a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** for faster photo delivery across the globe, reducing latency for users in different regions.
